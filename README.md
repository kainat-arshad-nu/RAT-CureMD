# Rat-Project-CureMD

The following project was done for the Research Aptitude Test of CureMD.The following contains critical reviews of the below mentioned papers:
  1-Explainable AI for Classification using Probabilistic Logic Inference
  
  2-Causability and explainability of artificial intelligence in medicine

The heart.csv file is the dataset of Heart Failure Prediction Dataset acquired from kaggle.
Information of dataset:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

The notebook file contains training and testing of the dataset, including the data preprocessing. Visulaizations are done to point out the important features of the dataset. Furthermore, Implementation of the paper (1) Explainable AI for Classification using Probabilistic Logic Inference is done.
